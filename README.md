```
2. *decode()*: Parses a JWT token string, verifies its signature, and returns the decoded payload along with expiration information, throwing an error if the token is invalid or expired.
```
decode(token):DecodedJwt
```
3. *validate()*: Checks the validity of a JWT token, including its signature and expiration time, returning a boolean indicating whether the token is currently valid and usable.
